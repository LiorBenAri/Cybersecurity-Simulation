# Cybersecurity-Simulation
C++ Project on University's Systems Programming course.

# Main Idea
From the assignment instructions:

"In this assignment you will simulate an exciting cyber-battle
between vicious cyber-worms, malicious programs that wreak
havoc online spreading between innocent computers via network
connections, and cyber-experts, courageous cyber-warriors
braving the dark web with only one mission - free the network
from the scourge of the cyber-worms!
The simulation will run in time-steps, each time-step simulates
the events occurring during one day. During each time-step actions
will occur according to a pre-determined set of rules".

# Main Features
Object-oriented programing, STL-based data structures, memory management, Boost library.
